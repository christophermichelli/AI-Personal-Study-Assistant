# Smart Study Planner is an interactive AI-powered study assistant that helps students optimize their study schedule. 
# The system uses machine learning (KNN) to predict the student's weaker subjects and recommends where the student should focus their study time.
# The app provides personalized AI-generated study plans based on student input, making it a practical tool for improving learning efficiency.

#**Note:** This is currently a demo version using simulated student data to test the machine learning model. It can be extended to work with real student datasets.
